# Dijkstras
Let us assume that we are at a Source point 'S'. 
Now we need to reach a destination in a metropolitan city. We may have several linking routes to the destination but the objective is to reach in the minimum possible time.
Considering only distance and reducing the factors of traffic, congestion and blockade we can consider a weighted directed graph that includes all possible routes to the Destination 'D'.
This problem is solved by Dijkstra Algorithm.
We get the minimum distance from 'S' to 'D' and thus travel the smallest route.
If we consider real time traffic and data analysis on routes with min and max time on a specific route or all possible routes, we can build the analysis on time rather than distance and find the route from 'S' to 'D' with minimum possible time.
